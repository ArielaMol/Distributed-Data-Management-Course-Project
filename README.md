# Distributed Data Management Course Project

This repository contains the implementation of Project 1 for the course **Distributed Database Management (096224)** at Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Spring 2024.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a data processing pipeline for the “Distributed Media Association” using PySpark. Specifically, the project focuses on:

- Detecting and removing malicious (spam) entries in the daily program schedule based on multiple logical conditions.
- Analyzing genre popularity across designated market areas (DMAs).
- Ranking DMAs by wealth and distributing genres accordingly under data replication constraints.
- Proposing and discussing an efficient data fragmentation design for distributed storage under realistic limitations.
- Applying distributed database design principles and big data processing techniques in a practical setting.

## 📁 Contents

- `project1_part1.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for Part 1: Spam detection and condition-based filtering using PySpark.
- `project1_part2.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook for Part 2: Genre popularity analysis, DMA wealth scoring, and distributed design discussion.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- PySpark (Spark 3+)
- Databricks/Azure cloud environment
- Python 3.x
